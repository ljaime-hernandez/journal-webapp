# Journal Webapp

Webapp link: https://journal-webapp.netlify.app/

Webapp designed to practice several uses on React such as:

* use Redux store with ascynchronous actions, dispatch, states, and middlewares
* troubleshoot Redux by using Redux DevTools
* apply Google (could be Apple, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub) and regular registration or login methods 
* file and data storage with both firebase and cloudinary
* private and public routes with React Router V5
* CRUD towards Firestore
* functional use of SASS
* adding multiple reducers to firestore
* date formatting with moment.js
* popup displays with sweetalert2
* email validation with validator dependency 
* unit testing (more information on the test section and each test file in the source folder)

more information about the webapp functionality can be found in each file and this readme file which has 
been extensively documented for educational purposes. thanks for taking your time to review my code or 
notes and leave either a comment or a star if you found it useful.
